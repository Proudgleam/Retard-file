STEP 2: ACQUISITION 

I. INTRODUCTION TO R PROGRAMMING 
 

• R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, 
graphics representation and reporting. R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert 
Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand 

• This programming language was named R, based on the first letter of first name of the 
two R authors (Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka) 

• R allows integration with the procedures written in the C, C++, .Net, Python or 
FORTRAN languages for efficiency. 

• R is a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes 
conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.   

• R has an effective data handling and storage facility   

• R provides a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, lists, vectors and  matrices.   

• R provides a large, coherent and integrated collection of tools for data analysis.   

• R provides graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the 
computer or printing at the papers.  

• R is the world’s most widely used statistics programming language.

Data frames : 

• Tabular data objects.  

• Each column can contain different modes of data. The first column can be numeric 
while the second column can be character and third column can be logical.  

• It is a list of vectors of equal length.  

• Data Frames are created using the data.frame() function.  

 

II. To create a data frame using given data 
 

Procedure for doing the Experiment:  



4 
 

1. Represent the various columns of the data frame by the vectors x, 

y, z ……  

   2. A=data.frame(x,y,z,…..) creates the data frame. 

 

Example 

R code: 

  A =data.frame(  name=c("A","B","C"), 

gender = c("Male", "Male","Female"), 

height = c(152, 171.5, 165), 

weight = c(81,93, 78), 

age =c(42,38,26)) 

 A 

(OR) 

name=c("A","B","C") 

gender = c("Male", "Male","Female") 

height = c(152, 171.5, 165) 

weight = c(81,93, 78) 

age =c(42,38,26) 

 A=data.frame(name,gender,height,weight,age) 

 A 

Output 

name gender height  weight age 
1    A   Male    152.0     81   42 
2    B   Male    171.5     93   38 
3    C  Female  165.0     78   26

3. M, summer, cotton, null, animal, 380 
4. M, Winter, cotton, null, patchwork, 450 
5. L, autumn, linen, ruffles, animal, 420 

R Code: 

size =c("L","M","M","M","L") 
             season=c("Spring","Summer","Summer","Winter","Autumn") 
             material=c("silk","chiffon","cotton","cotton","linen") 
decoration=c("Embroidery","Bow","Null","Null","Ruffles") 
patterntype=c("dot","print","animal","patchwork","animal") 
price=c(650,275,380,450,420) 
             D=data.frame(size,season,material,decoration,patterntype,price)

APPLICATIONS OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTION 

    
STEP 1: INTRODUCTION 

OBJECTIVES OF THE EXPERIMENT 
To predict values and compute probabilities using normal distribution 
 
STEP 2: ACQUISITION 

The normal distribution is defined by the following probability density function, where μ is the 

population mean and σ2 is the variance.  

 
If a random variable X follows the normal distribution, then we write:   
The normal distribution with μ = 0 and σ = 1 is called the standard normal distribution, and is 
denoted as N(0,1). 

Consider a normal distribution with mean 𝜇 and standard deviation 𝜎 
 
 
 
R-code for doing the Experiment:  

1. To find 𝑃(𝑋 < 𝑎) = 𝑃(−∞ < 𝑋 < 𝑎) 
R-code : 
pnorm(𝑎, mean = 𝜇, sd = 𝜎)     

    2.  To find 𝑃(𝑋 > 𝑎) = 𝑃(𝑎 < 𝑋 < ∞) 
R-code: 
pnorm(𝑎, mean = 𝜇, sd = 𝜎,  lower.tail = FALSE)     

    3. To find 𝑃(𝑎 < 𝑋 < 𝑏) 
R-code: 
pnorm(𝑏, mean = 𝜇, sd = 𝜎)   -  pnorm(𝑎, mean = 𝜇, sd = 𝜎)     

To find 𝑃(𝑋 < 𝑎) = 𝑃(−∞ < 𝑋 < 𝑎) 

 

pnorm ( a, mean = , sd =  ) 

To find 𝑃(𝑋 > 𝑎) = 𝑃(𝑎 < 𝑋 < ∞) 



26 
 

 

pnorm(𝑎, mean = 𝜇, sd = 𝜎, lower.tail = FALSE)     

To find 𝑃(𝑎 < 𝑋 < 𝑏) 

 

pnorm(𝑏, mean = 𝜇, sd = 𝜎)   -  pnorm(𝑎, mean = 𝜇, sd = 𝜎)     

Note: 
Use lower.tail=TRUE if you are finding the probability at the lower tail of a confidence interval 
or if you want to estimate the probability of values no larger than z. 
 
Use lower.tail=FALSE if you aretrying to calculate probability at the upper confidence limit, 
or you want the probability of values z or larger.

APPLICATIONS OF STUDENT T-TEST 

    

STEP 1: INTRODUCTION 

OBJECTIVES OF THE EXPERIMENT 

     1. To apply t-test to test hypothesis about population mean 

     2. To apply t-test to test hypothesis about two means 

     3. To apply paired t-test to test hypotheses about means of two dependent samples 

STEP 2: ACQUISITION 

Student’s t – distribution 

Student's t-distribution has the probability density function given by 

−  t    

where  is the number of degrees of freedom and  is the gamma function. This may also be written 

as 

−  t    

Note:  (a) The values of t ( )  can be got from the t – table 

(b)  t (2 )gives the critical value of t for a single tail test at   LOS and  d.f 

For eg,   t8(0.05) for single tailed test = t8(10) for two-tailed test = 1.86 

Test of Hypothesis about the Population Mean

Test statistic  t =  follows t – distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom.

where  S 2 1
x = xi   and            =  (xi − x)  

n i=1 n −1 i=1

Null hypothesis H0  : There is no significant difference between the sample mean x  and the 

population mean  . 



31 
 

If t   tabulated t, then H0 is accepted and the difference between x  and   is not considered 

significant. 

Assumptions for t – test for population mean 

1. The parent population from which the sample is drawn is normal. 
2. The sample observations are independent 
3. The population standard deviation   is unknown. 

Test of Hypothesis about the difference between two means  

 To test a hypothesis concerning the difference between the means of two normally distributed 
populations, when the population variances are unknown, t – test is used. 

H0:  The samples have been drawn from  populations with same means, ie, 1 = 2

Test statistic is t =  ~  tn1+n2 −2

s1 =  xi − x , s2 =  (y j − y)

n1 i n2 j  
(Note :  S2 is an unbiased estimate of the population variance  2

) 

The test statistic follows t-distribution with   n1 +n2 -2 degrees of freedom. 

If t   tabulated t, then H0 is accepted and the difference between x  and   is not considered 

significant. 

Paired t-test for difference of Means 

If the two given samples are dependent, ie, each observation in one sample is associated with a 
particular observation in the second sample, then we use paired t – test to test whether the  means 
differ significantly or not. Here , both the samples will have same number of units. 

The test statistic is     

d 1 n 1 ( 2
t = where   d = d i and d i = xi − yi , S 2 =  d i − d )  

S / n n i=1 n −1
t follows t – distribution with n-1 d.f.  Here n is the number of pairs in the sample 



32 
 

 

Using R for testing of hypothesis 

The R function t.test() can be used to perform both one and two sample t-tests on vectors of data.   
The function contains a variety of options and can be called as follows:  

t.test(x, y = NULL, alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"), mu = 0, paired = FALSE, var.equal 
= FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)  

Here x is a numeric vector of data values and y is an optional numeric vector of data values. If y is 
excluded, the function performs a one-sample t-test on the data contained in x, if it is included it 
performs a two-sample t-tests using both x and y.   

 The option mu provides a number indicating the true value of the mean (or difference in means if you 
are performing a two sample test) under the null hypothesis. The option alternative is a character string 
specifying the alternative hypothesis, and must be one of the following: "two.sided" (which is the 
default), "greater" or "less" depending on whether the alternative hypothesis is that the mean is different 
than, greater than or less than mu, respectively. 

Procedure for doing the Experiment: 

1. To test hypothesis about population mean: 
(a)For a two-tailed test 

x = c( a1 , a2 ,.....aN ) 

t.test(x,alternative="two.sided",mu=  ) 

(b) For a one-tailed test 

x = c( a1 , a2 ,.....aN ) 

t.test(x,alternative="less"/"greater",mu=  ) 

    2.  To test hypothesis about two means 
A= c( a1 ,a2 ,.....am )   

B = c(b1 ,b2 ,.....bn )    

t.test(A,B,alternative="two.sided"/"less"/"greater",, var.equal=TRUE)  
    3.  To use paired t-test 

A= c( a1 ,a2 ,.....am )   

B = c(b1 ,b2 ,.....bn )    

t.test(A,B,alternative="greater"/"less"/"two.sided",paired=TRUE) 
 

EXAMPLE – Single mean 

Eleven articles produced by a factory were chosen at random and their weights were 

found to be (in kgs) 63,63,66,67,68,69,70,70,71,71,71 respectively.  In the light of the 

above data, can we assume that the mean weight of the articles produced by the factory 

is 66 kgs? (Given: the critical value of t  for 10 degrees of freedom at 5% LOS is 2.28). 



33 
 

NullHypothesis : H0 : = 66  

Alternative Hypothesis : H1 :  66  

R-code 

x = c(63,63,66,67,68,69,70,70,71,71,71) 

t.test(x,alternative="two.sided",mu=66) 

Output:  

One Sample t-test 

data:  x 

t = 2.3, df = 10, p-value = 0.04425 

alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 66 

95 percent confidence interval: 

66.06533 70.11649 

sample estimates: 

mean of x  

68.09091  

Conclusion: t -value = 2.3 >  2.228. Hence we reject H 0  and we may conclude that the mean  

weight of the articles produced by the factory is not 66.

APPLICATIONS OF F TEST 

   

STEP 1: INTRODUCTION 

OBJECTIVES OF THE EXPERIMENT 

To apply F-test to compare the variances of two samples from normal populations. 

STEP 2: ACQUISITION 

The null hypothesis is that the ratio of the variances of the populations from which x and y were 
drawn, or in the data to which the linear models x and y were fitted, is equal to ratio. 
 
Procedure for doing the Experiment:  

 R-Code for F-test: 

var.test(x, y, ratio = 1,alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),conf.level 
= 0.95, ...) 

Note: 

x, y - numeric vectors of data values, or fitted linear model objects (inheriting 
from class "lm"). 

Ratio  - the hypothesized ratio of the population variances of x and y. 

Alternative - a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one 
of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less". You can specify just the 
initial letter. 

conf.level - confidence level for the returned confidence interval. 

In the test statistic, the greater of the two variances 𝑆 2
1  and 𝑆 2

2  is to be taken in the 
numerator and 𝑣1 corresponds to the greater variance. 

Example:  

Two samples of 6 and 7 items respectively have the following values for a variable 
Sample 1 39 41 42 42 44 40 
Sample 2 40 42 39 45 38 39 40 
Do the sample variances differ significantly? 

 

Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in sample variances. 



44 
 

Alternative Hypothesis: There is a significant difference in sample variances. 

Code: 

x=c(40,42,39,45,38,39,40) 
y=c(39,41,42,42,44,40) 
var.test(x, y, ratio = 1, 
alternative = c("two.sided"),  
conf.level = 0.95) 
Output: 

F test to compare two variances  
data:  x and y 
F = 1.8323, numdf = 6, denomdf = 5, p-value = 0.523 
alternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1 
95 percent confidence interval: 
  0.2625934 10.9710044 
sample estimates: 
ratio of variances  
          1.832298  

Critical value of F  for (6, 5) d.f. is F0.05 = 4.95  

Conclusion:Since F  F0.05  , weaccept the null hypothesis and we may conclude that  

there is no significant difference in the sample variances. 
 

 

Task 1: 

Two random samples drawn from two normal populations are 

Sample 1: 20 16 26 27 23 22 18 24 25 19

Sample 1:  9 11 13 11 15 9 12 14 

Sample 2:  10 12 10 14 9 8 10 

Can we conclude that the two samples have drawn from the same normal population. 

To test whether the samples come from the same normal population, we have to test for 

a. Equality of population means 
b. Equality of population variances. 

Equality of means is tested using t-test and equality of variances is tested using F-test. 

2 2
Since t-test assumes   1 =  2 , we first apply F-test and then t-test.

APPLICATION OF CHI SQUARE TEST 

 STEP 1: INTRODUCTION 

OBJECTIVES OF THE EXPERIMENT 

     1. To apply chi square test for goodness of fit     

     2. To apply chi square test for independence of attributes 

STEP 2: ACQUISITION 

Conditions for the validity of   2
-test 

1. The sample observations must be independent of one another. 
2. The sample size must be reasonably large, say   50. 
3. No individual frequency should be less than 5.  If any frequency is less than 5, then it 

is pooled with the preceding or succeeding frequency so that the pooled frequency is 
more than 5.  Finally adjust for the d.f  lost in pooling. 

4. The number of classes k must be neither too small nor too large, ie 4  k  16  
 

 2
-test of goodness of fit  

Tests ofgoodness of fit are used when we want to determine whether an actual sample 
distribution matches a known theoretical distribution.  It enables us to find if the deviation of 
the experiment from theory is just by chance or it is due to the inadequacy of the theory to fit 
the data. 

Null Hypothesis: H0: The difference  between the observed and expected frequencies is not 
significant.  ie, the theory fits well into the given data. 

Regular method: Let Oi (i = 1,2,....n)  be a set of observed frequencies and Ei (i = 1,2,....n) be 

n ( 2
2 O − )

 = i E
the corresponding set of expected frequencies. Then     i  follows Chi- Square 

i=1 Ei

Distribution with n – 1 d.f. 

(One degree of freedom is subtracted for the constraint Oi =Ei ) 
i i

2 2
Compare the calculated  -value with the tabulated  -value (with n – 1 d.f)  and form the 

conclustion. 

 2
- test of Independence of Attributes 



52 
 

 2
- test isused for testing the null hypothesis that two criteria of classification are 

independent.  Let the two attributes be A and B, where A has r categories and B has s 
categories.  Thus the members of the population and hence, those of the sample are divided 
into rsclasses.  Let the total number of observations be N.  The observations are arranged in 
the form of a matrix, called contingency table . 

H0:The attributes A and B are independent. 

Regular method: 

The expected frequencies Eij  for various cells are calculated using the formula: 

RiC j
Eij = , i =1,2,....r, j =1,2.....s

 = ;        N = a + b + c + d ,

Procedure for doing the Experiment: 

1. R-code for testing goodness of fit: 
f=vector of observed frequencies 
p= vector of expected ratios (probabilities) 
a=chisq.test(f,p=c(p1 ,p2 , ….))

ANOVA – ONE WAY CLASSIFICATION 

STEP 1: INTRODUCTION 

OBJECTIVES OF THE EXPERIMENT 

To perform analysis of variance for a completely randomized design 

STEP 2: ACQUISITION 

Analysis of variance refers to the separation of variance ascribable to one group of causes 
from the variance ascribable to the other group.   It is used to test the homogeneity of several 
means. 

Three types of variation are present in a data 

1. Treatments 
2. Environmental 
3. Residual or Error 

Assumptions for ANOVA test 

1. The observations are independent. 
2. The parent population is normal 
3. Various treatment and environmental effects are additive in nature. 
4. The samples have been randomly selected from the population 

Null Hypothesis: All the population means are equal 

Alternative Hypothesis: Some of the means are not equal. 

Three important designs of experiments: 

1. Completely Randomised Design (CRD) – One-way classification 
2. Randomised Block Design (RBD) – Two-way classification 
3. Latin Square Design (LSD) – Three-way classification 

Procedure for doing the Experiment: 

     1. aov(response~factor,data=data_name)

ANOVA – TWO WAY CLASSIFICATION 

STEP 1: INTRODUCTION 

OBJECTIVES OF THE EXPERIMENT 

      To perform analysis of variance for a Randomised Block Design. 

STEP 2: ACQUISITION 

The data collected from experiments with randomised block design form a two-way 
classification, classified according to two factors – blocks and treatments. The two-way table 
has k rows and r columns – ie, N=kr entries.  

Consider an agricultural experiment in which we wish to test the effect of k fertilising 
treatments on the yield of a crop. We divide the plots into r blocks, according to soil fertility, 
each block containing k plots.  The plots in each block will be of homogeneous fertility. I 
each block, the k treatments are given to the k plots in a random manner in such a way that 
each treatment occurs only once in each block.  The same k treatments are repeated from 
block to block. 

H01  : There is no difference in the yield of crop due to treatments 

H02  : There is no difference in the yield of crop due to blocks 

Procedure for doing the Experiment:  

Consider a two way table with k rows and r columns 

1. a=c(a1 , a2 ,………) (entries entered columnwise) 
f=c("row1","row2","row3","row4","row5") 
k=5 
r=4 
A=gl(k,1,r*k,factor(f))  
A 
B=gl(r,k,k*r)  
B 
av = aov(a ~ A+B) 
summary(av) 

 

Example 

The following data represents the number of units of loom crank bushes produced per day 
turned out by different workers using four different types of machines.

F0.05 (3,12) = 3.49  

F  = 6.54 > F0.05 (1 4,12) = 3.26 , hence we reject H01 and conclude that the 5 workers differ 

with respect to mean productivity. 

F2 = 18.388 > F0.05 (3,12) = 3.49 , hence we reject H02 and conclude that the 4 machines differ 

with respect to mean productivity.

CONTROL CHARTS FOR VARIABLES (MEAN AND RANGE CHART) 

 

STEP 1: INTRODUCTION 

OBJECTIVES OF THE EXPERIMENT 

To plot X - chart and R-chart and comment on the state of control of the process. 

STEP 2: ACQUISITION 

Statistical Quality Control is a statistical method for finding whether the variation in the 
quality of the product is due to random causes or assignable causes 

Control chart is a graphical device used in statistical quality control for the study and control 
of the manufacturing process. 

There are two types of control charts: 

1. Control charts of variables (Mean ( X )and range (R)charts) 
2. Control charts of attributes (p-chart, np-chart, c-chart) 

The Lower control limit and Upper control limit for mean  and range charts 

        1. X chart                LCL: X − A2 R                     UCL:  X + A2 R
 

 2.  R-Chart               LCL: D3 R                          UCL: D4 R
 

Procedure to plot  X  and R charts using RStudio 

To install qcc package in RStudio go to the “Tools” menu, select “Install Packages…” and 
type “qcc” into the packages field being sure to also select “Install Dependencies” and click 
“Install.” 

Load the data from a.csv file with one subgroup per row : 

my.data = read.csv("my-data.csv",header=FALSE)  
 OR,  
Load the data for each subgroup manually:  
a1 = c(                )  
a2 = c(               )  
a3 = c(                )   etc. 
If there is  more than one subgroup, create a dataframe:  my.data = rbind(a1,a2,a3) 

Procedure for doing the Experiment:  



78 
 

Suppose the given values are x, y, z, ……. 

1. R code to create dataframe 

S1=c(a1 , a2 ,……) 
S2=c(b1 , b2 ,……) 
A= as.data.frame(rbind(S1,S2,……..)) 
A 

2. For X  chart: 

Xbarchart= qcc(data = A, 
                   type = "xbar", 
                   sizes = n,   # n=number of items in each sample 
                   title = "X-bar Chart ",                     
                   plot = TRUE) 
 

      3. For R chart: 

rchart = qcc(data = A, 
                   type = "R", 
                   sizes = n,  # n=number of items in each sample 
                   title = "R Chart", 
                   plot = TRUE) 
 

 

Example 

The measurements are given below with 5 samples each containing 5 items at equal 

intervals of time.  Construct X  and R charts and comment on the state of control.

   V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 

S1 46 45 44 43 42 

S2 41 41 44 42 40 

S3 40 40 42 40 42 

S4 42 43 43 42 45 

S5 43 44 47 47 45 

 

For R chart: 

R-code: 

rchart = qcc(data = A, 



80 
 

type = "R", 

sizes = 5, 

title = "R Chart", 

plot = TRUE) 

Output: 

 

Conclusion: 

In X  chart, two points are beyond the control limits, so as far as sample mean is concerned, 
the system is out of control. 

In R chart, all points are within the control limits, so as far as variability is concerned, the 
system is under control. 

On the whole, the system is out of control.
